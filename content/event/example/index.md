summary: '' #Improving learning with noisy labels in two possibile scenarios.
abstract: 'Learning from data with noisy labels is a challenging problem that arises in various practical applications. Noisy data can indeed arise in various real-world problems, such as medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, fraud detection, and natural language processing. Its presence can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. In this talk, we will introduce two different frameworks for improving learning with noisy labels in two possible scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume access to data labeled by multiple annotators. In the second scenario, only one label is given for each sample. For the first case, we will leverage inter-rater agreement to effectively mitigate the issue of noisy labels. In the second scenario, our framework proposes a novel approach that combines the use of class centroids and an outlier discounting strategy.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
